# Vote Extensions

This specification details the functionality and purpose of the `ExtendVoteHandler` and `VerifyVoteExtensionHandler` methods within the VoteExtHandler struct. These methods are part of a voting extension process where validators extend their votes based on the availability of data in the Avail DA network.

### ExtendVoteHandler

The `ExtendVoteHandler` method is responsible for generating a `vote extension`. It checks the availability of specific data in the Avail by interacting with an Avail light client. The vote extension is then created based on the outcome of this check.

* The method first begins by retrieving several voting-related parameters, including the start and end heights of the blocks being processed, the Avail block height, and the status of the current blob (data)

```go
from := h.Keeper.GetStartHeightFromStore(ctx)
		end := h.Keeper.GetEndHeightFromStore(ctx)

		availHeight := h.Keeper.GetAvailHeightFromStore(ctx)

		pendingRangeKey := Key(from, end)

		blobStatus := h.Keeper.GetBlobStatus(ctx)
		currentHeight := ctx.BlockHeight()
		voteEndHeight := h.Keeper.GetVotingEndHeightFromStore(ctx)
```

* The method checks if the current height is just before the end of the voting period and if the blob is in the voting state. If not, it generates a basic vote extension indicating that no data was verified

```go
if currentHeight+1 != int64(voteEndHeight) || blobStatus != IN_VOTING_STATE {
			voteExt := VoteExtension{
				Votes: Votes,
			}

			// json marshalling
			votesBytes, err := json.Marshal(voteExt)
			if err != nil {
				return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to marshal vote extension: %w", err)
			}
			abciResponseVoteExt.VoteExtension = votesBytes
			return abciResponseVoteExt, nil
		}
```

* If the conditions are met, the method queries the Avail light client to determine if the relevant data is available. The result of this check is recorded in a map
```go
    ok, err := h.Keeper.relayer.IsDataAvailable(ctx, from, end, availHeight, "http://localhost:8000")
		if ok {
			h.logger.Info("submitted data to Avail verified successfully at",
				"block_height", availHeight,
			)
		}

		
		Votes[pendingRangeKey] = ok
```

* The outcome (whether the data was available or not) is marshaled into a vote extension and returned as part of the abci.ResponseExtendVote

```go
    voteExt := VoteExtension{
			Votes: Votes,
		}

		votesBytes, err := json.Marshal(voteExt)
		if err != nil {
			return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to marshal vote extension: %w", err)
		}

		return &abci.ResponseExtendVote{
			VoteExtension: votesBytes,
		}, nil
```

### VerifyVoteExtensionHandler
The `VerifyVoteExtensionHandler` method is responsible for validating the format and content of the vote extensions generated by the `ExtendVoteHandler`.

This method performs a basic validation check on the received vote extension, ensuring it meets the necessary format requirements. It then returns a response indicating whether the vote extension is accepted.
