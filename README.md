### Posting cosmos sdk based applications data to Avail DA

Weâ€™ve created a module that allows Cosmos SDK-based blockchain applications to post data to Avail DA. By integrating this module into your application, you can easily send your data to the Avail light client, where it will be validated and then posted to the DA.

You can integrate this module into both Cosmos SDK-based applications and those generated with Spawn, which also uses the Cosmos SDK.

For detailed instructions on how to integrate the module with a Cosmos SDK application, please refer to the [integration guide](./docs/integration.md).

For detailed instructions on how to integrate the module with a spawn generated application, please refer to the [integration guide](./docs/spawn.md).
