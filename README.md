# Cada (Cosmos Avail DA module)

CADA is a module designed to connect Cosmos sovereign chains with the Avail network, making it easier for any Cosmos chain or rollapp to use Avail as their Data Availability (DA) layer. With CADA, developers can improve the scalability and security of their decentralized applications within the Cosmos ecosystem. It enables better data handling and availability, allowing Cosmos-based chains to tap into the strengths of Avail and build a more connected and resilient blockchain network.

For detailed instructions on how to integrate the module with a Cosmos SDK application, please refer to the [integration guide](./docs/integration.md).

For detailed instructions on how to integrate the module with a spawn generated application, please refer to the [integration guide](./docs/spawn.md).
